# ElementaryCelularAutomata
This program generates a simulation of the evolution of a one dimensional celullar automata with binary states. It consists in rules of a neighborhood that contains 3 cells with which 256 (2^8) diferent rulesets can be made. It is based on the Elemenetary Cellular Automata designed by Wolfram in 1983.
